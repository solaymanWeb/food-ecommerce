            Sarah Haddad is the passionate creator of ‘Lebanese Food Emporium’,
            primarily an online Lebanese grocery store that delivers to your
            door.
            <br /><br />
            Upon moving to Newcastle from Sydney, 4 years ago Sarah and her
            family quickly learnt that there was not much availability of Middle
            Eastern cuisine in the way of restaurants, take-aways, groceries and
            products. More importantly there where literally no Middle Eastern
            grocery store or bakery servicing the entire Central Coast, Lake
            Macquarie, Newcastle, Port Stephens and further to the Northern NSW.
            <br /><br />
            Sarah, being an active mum in the community, soon had her
            realisations confirmed through certain online mothers’ groups and
            continual friendly locals stating the same facts.
            <br /><br />
            Whenever Sarah’s family would visit from Sydney to Newcastle, Sarah
            kindly had to ask them to cart along a tone of Lebanese groceries
            and fresh Lebanese bread for her family. Sarah’s investigations
            indicated that there were many families living along the Central to
            North Coast getting by in the same way she was. Not only that, but
            many people also simply love Middle Eastern foods and grocery and
            were patiently waiting for someone to open up shop near them.
            <br /><br />
            Our fascination for delicious Lebanese flavours, distinctive aromas,
            exotic tastes and unique textures are what drive us, along with our
            commitment to outstanding quality and service.
            <br /><br />
            Our team has been bringing you our extensive array of Lebanese
            grocery and Lebanese products since 2020. With over 18 years’
            combined experience in the industry, we are ready and willing to
            share our knowledge and passion for food, and all things Lebanese
            with you!
            <br /><br />
            Our family is tirelessly involved in every aspect of our daily
            operations from ordering to delivery, ensuring a hands-on and

            Australian made fresh products used in manufacturing Lebanese
            cuisine and supporting local Australian farmers. We also have daily
            concern with the ongoing current situation in Lebanon and the Middle
            East, therefore we are trying to expand our product range to
            incorporate as many imported dry goods and products to assist on
            ground level. We also carefully select the finest ingredients from
            all over the world. Our product lines are vast so if there are
            products you cannot see on our site then just ask!

            Sarah has been hands on in working feverishly on her website… “I had
            many inspiring comments sent in to me, when the business was 1st
            established and ordering was via a simple spread sheet on Facebook.
            One popular comment I received time and time again was from
            non-Arabic customers (believe it or not), stating “if only you had a
            description and photos of products and groceries I’d buy more!” So,
            I have built a website that’s easy to navigate, full of in-depth
            product descriptions, loads of photos and even a ‘What is this
            product?’ clickable description.”
